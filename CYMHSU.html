                     <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                     <p>The Vancouver Children and Youth Mental Health and Substance website is intended to provide the user with the intake form based on clinics around the catchment area through a triaging system. This is a four-month project that was done during my co-op term with Vancouver Coastal Health – Learning Technologies, in collaboration with the Vancouver CYMHSU team. Currently, the project is still in its pilot phase and is expected to launch in Spring 2023.</a>

                     <h3>CONTRIBUTIONS</h3>
                     <p>I led the team on the initial research regarding topics around Mental Health, specifically catered towards users below the age of 18 years old. I began by conducting thorough breakdowns and case studies of businesses and organizations in the Mental Health Wellbeing Realm. This foundation allowed us to better understand the landscape. We then proceeded with user interviews involving nurses from one of the clinics in the catchment area, which provided us with valuable insights into the issues clients might encounter while filling out physical intake forms and scheduling appointments during clinic walk-ins.
                     </p>

                     <p>To align with VCH's commitment to diversity and inclusivity, and to foster greater empathy for our targeted users, we also interviewed the Indigenous Nurse Representative team in VCH. This additional perspective helped us gain deeper knowledge about the struggles and issues that Indigenous children may face growing up in Vancouver's neighborhoods. These insights collectively guided us in finalizing our three initial design directions and setting the tone for the website. When we presented these approaches to stakeholders and working groups, they were met with positive reception both internally and externally.</p>

                     <p>Due to unpredicted circumstances and with extending the stakeholders, the project brand guidelines and design have to be pivoted to follow the new Vancouver Coastal Health brand that was created in tandem with the project. Despite having limitations on the design, our team leaned more towards the interaction so that the website can still cater specifically to our targetted audience.

                    <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
                    <p>With the plan to merge our design into <a class="text-link" href="https://www.vch.ca/en"> the VCH website</a>, my contributions, particularly in mapping out the user journey, identifying potential pain points for the patients, and articulating our design decisions, played a key role within the organization. These insights not only influenced our project but also provided a deeper understanding of the entire VCH website architecture. Consequently, they prompted a reevaluation of the website's overall usability, benefiting not only our immediate project but also enhancing the broader VCH online presence.
