                     <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                     <p>The Vancouver Children and Youth Mental Health and Substance website is intended to provide the user with the intake form based on clinics around the catchment area through a triaging system. This is a four-month project that was done during my co-op term with Vancouver Coastal Health – Learning Technologies, in collaboration with the Vancouver CYMHSU team. Currently, the project is still in its pilot phase and is expected to launch in Spring 2023.</a>

                     <h3>CONTRIBUTIONS</h3>
                     <p>I led the team on the initial research about the topic of Mental Health, specifically catered towards users below the age of 18 years old. Through user interviews with nurses from one of the clinics in the catchment area, and getting to know deeper from the target audience, I designed three different approaches to how the website could be developed. The approaches were well received internally and by the working group.
                     </p>

                     <p>Due to unpredicted circumstances and with extending the stakeholders, the project brand guidelines and design have to be pivoted to follow the new Vancouver Coastal Health brand that was created in tandem with the project. Despite having limitations on the design, our team leaned more towards the interaction so that the website can still cater specifically to our targetted audience.
