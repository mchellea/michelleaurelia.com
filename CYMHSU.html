                     <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                     <p>The Vancouver Children and Youth Mental Health and Substance website is intended to provide the user the intake form based on clinics around catchment area through a triaging system. This is a four-months project that was done during my co-op term with Vancouver Coastal Health – Learning Technologies, in collaboartion with Vancouver CYMHSU team. Currently the project is still in it's pilot phase and expected to launch in Spring 2023.</a>

                     <h3>CONTRIBUTIONS</h3>
                     <p>I led the team on the initial research about the topic of Mental Health, specifically catered towards users below the age of 18-years old. Through user interviews with nurses from one of the clinic in the catchment area, and getting to know deeper from a user that had been in theraphy for a while, I designed three different approaches on how the website could be developed. The approaches were well received internally and from the working group.
                     </p>

                     <p>Due to unpredicted circumstances and with extending the stakeholders, the project brand guidelines and design have to be pivoted to follow the new Vancouver Coastal Health brand that was created in tandem with the project. Despite having limitations on the design, our team leaned more towards the interaction so that the website can still cater specifically to our targetted audience.
