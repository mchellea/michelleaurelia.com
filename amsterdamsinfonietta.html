                    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                    <p>A 5-week visual design project for our senior experience design class, with the end goal of creating a visual identity that translates into an expressive microsite for our assigned client, Dutch string orchestra Amsterdam Sinfonietta. This was achieved through extensive study of our precedent graphic designers to help to ground our process and experimentations.
                    </p>
                    <p>A new Bosch Requiem had been performed annually since 2016, to commemorate the legacy of the passing Dutch painter, Hieronymus Bosch. We created an expressive microsite dedicated as a pre-purchase medium for their 2022 concert, performed by Amsterdam Sinfonietta. </p>

                    <h3>PRECEDENT</h3>
                    <p>We began our exploration by analyzing Wolfgang Weingart's work and adapting Ellen Lupton's design principles. Weingart's work relies heavily on how to use and break the rules and the rigidness of Swiss Designs that initially follows a strict principle in Grid, Typography, and Negative Space. Our main focus is to see how far the qualities of Swiss Designs can be pushed and still retain their purpose. We gathered a few approaches to guide us during our experimentation process:

                <h3>ART DIRECTION</h3>
                <p>I led my team in analyzing our precedent designer's work starting from breaking down Weingart's Letter M Study, along with Dan Friedman's Rythm study to achieve a pleasant composition through randomness. Through the process, I also kept in mind focusing more on challenging the legibility and relationship between text through contrast type scale.
                </p>
                <p>We designed a strict grid system underneath our first poster so elements can establish a visual relationship with each other. Thus, this is the reason why I decided to pair our grotesk font with a monotype that has its own systemic flow underneath each type to further reinforce the structure. To test out the flexibility of the art direction before transforming it into a microsite, we placed our designs into different physical assets ranging from a wider form to smaller ones.

                   <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                   <p>As the Art Director, this project helped to pique my interest in leaning more about this field to explore more creative ideas and develop foundational assets for the team to work on. I'm grateful that this project helped me to be as creative as I can be, but also grounded in proper design principles and intentional even to the smallest element I put into my work. Furthermore, I also realized that learning from past designer work, and able to take away their principles into my styles and design help me to ground my work.</p>
